I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the [Department of Cyber Security Engineering](https://cybersecurity.gmu.edu) at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu).

I received my M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu), in 2016 and 2018.

My research explores security opportunities in **emerging computer architecture**, examines the **weaknesses in autonomous systems**, and builds hardware-derived primitives for developing **trusted computation frameworks**.
