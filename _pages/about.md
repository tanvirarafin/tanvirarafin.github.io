I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the [Department of Cyber Security Engineering](https://cybersecurity.gmu.edu) at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu).

I received my M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu), in 2016 and 2018.

My research explores security opportunities in **emerging computer architecture**, examines the **weaknesses in autonomous systems**, and builds hardware-derived primitives for developing **trusted computation frameworks**.

My work has been published at flagship venues in hardware design and security, such as [IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration Systems (TVLSI)](https://tvlsi.ieee.org), [IEEE Transaction of Computers (TC)](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tc), [ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)](https://iccad.com), and [Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)](https://www.aspdac.com/).

I won the [IEEE TC Featured Paper of the Month](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tc/misc/14417?title=Multimedia&periodical=IEEE%20Transactions%20on%20Computers) in 2022, the [Best Paper award at IEEE AsianHOST](http://asianhost.org/2022/) in 2018, the [Best Paper Nomination in ACM GLSVLSI in 2017](https://www.glsvlsi.org/archive/glsvlsi17/program.html), and [A. James Clerk School of Engineering Fellowship](https://eng.umd.edu/clark-doctoral-fellows) in 2012.

My research has been supported by funding and donations from NSF (Grant ID: [2240514](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2240514&HistoricalAwards=false), [2042700](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2042700&HistoricalAwards=false)), NSA, MIPS, NASA-JPL, ARLIS, and Xilinx.

## open positions

We have **several open positions** for motivated graduate students to participate in hardware design and computer security research.

If interested, please send an email along with your resume to **marafin(at)gmu(dot)edu**.
