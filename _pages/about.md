I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the [Department of Cyber Security Engineering](https://cybersecurity.gmu.edu) at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu).

Our research explores security opportunities in **emerging computer architecture**, examines the **weaknesses in autonomous systems**, and builds hardware-derived primitives for developing **trusted computation frameworks**.

Our work has been published at flagship venues in hardware design and security, such as [IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration Systems (TVLSI)](https://tvlsi.ieee.org), [IEEE Transaction of Computers (TC)](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tc), [ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)](https://iccad.com), and [Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)](https://www.aspdac.com/).

We won the [Best Poster/Demo Award at 
ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (WiSec)](https://wisec2025.gmu.edu/awards/) in 2025, the [Best Hardware Demo Award: 2nd Place at
IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST), 2024](http://www.hostsymposium.org/host_2024awards.php) in 2024, [IEEE TC Featured Paper of the Month](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tc/misc/14417?title=Multimedia&periodical=IEEE%20Transactions%20on%20Computers) in 2022, the [Best Paper award at IEEE AsianHOST](http://asianhost.org/2022/) in 2018, the [Best Paper Nomination in ACM GLSVLSI in 2017](https://www.glsvlsi.org/archive/glsvlsi17/program.html).

Our work has been supported by funding and donations from NSF (Grant ID: [2523805](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2523805&HistoricalAwards=false), [2519390](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2519390&HistoricalAwards=false), [2438599](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2438599&HistoricalAwards=false) [2245156](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2245156&HistoricalAwards=false), [2042700](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2042700&HistoricalAwards=false)), NSA, MIPS, NASA-JPL, ARLIS, and Xilinx.

## open positions

We always have  **<u> fully-funded GRA positions </u>** for motivated Ph.D. students to participate in hardware design and computer security research. You can find more details about the position [here](assets/pdf/announcement_spire_lab_2.pdf).
